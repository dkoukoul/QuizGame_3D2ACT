This Augmented Reality (AR) learning game was developed by University of Crete as part of IO3-A3 of the project “3D2ACT Fostering Industry 4.0 and 3D Technologies Through Social Entrepreneurship: An Innovative Programme for a Sustainable Future” (2020-1-EL01-KA202-078957)

It aims to support VET trainers in reaching our educational objectives i.e. the acquisition of social entrepreneurial skills and setting up a social enterprise. The mobile app should be used alongside the [Social Entrepreneurship Educational Pack](https://3d2act.eu/io3/). The AR game was defined as a multiple-choice quiz, accompanied by a gameboard, which includes images and QR codes that are used as answers to some of the quiz questions. The gameboard can be found [here](GameBoard_draft_final.pdf).
